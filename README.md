# Aurora Access

> “Freedom is not a feature — it’s a right written in light.”

Aurora Access is an experimental playground exploring digital identity, privacy transparency and human-centered AI. Built with a cosmic UI: `Python` (FastAPI), `Next.js`, `AI` and automation tools.

This repo is a minimal prototype (v0.1 Alpha).
